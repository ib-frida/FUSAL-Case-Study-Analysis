# FUSAL Malnutrition Case Study: Data Analysis Report

### Overview

This report is an analysis of malnutrition data for various communities in El Salvador from 2014 to 2017, conducted as part of the **Social Innovation diploma** at **UPEACE**, for the course **Monitoring & Evaluation Fundamentals: Measuring Outcomes & Impact**. The goal of this analysis is to detect malnutrition patterns, evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and provide actionable recommendations for improving community health outcomes.

### Key Communities Analyzed

-   **Guaymango**
-   **Chiltiupan**
-   **Apaneca**
-   **Ataco**
-   **San Julián**
-   **Cluster Morazán**

## 1. Patterns Observed in the Data

#### 1.1. **Guaymango**

Guaymango shows consistently **higher levels of chronic malnutrition** across all years, with a significant spike in 2014, where the rate surpassed 40%. After a sharp decline in 2015 to about 14%, malnutrition rates began to rise again, suggesting that while interventions in 2015 were initially effective, they were not sustainable over time.

#### 1.2. **Chiltiupan**

Chiltiupan exhibits a fluctuating pattern. Malnutrition rates dropped significantly in **2015**, indicating effective interventions or positive external factors during that year. However, this was followed by a rise in malnutrition in **2016** and **2017**, showing that the gains were short-lived, and the situation worsened again over time.

#### 1.3. **Apaneca and Ataco**

Both Apaneca and Ataco present a **positive trend** of declining malnutrition rates, especially after 2015. This suggests that the interventions in these communities have been more effective and sustained compared to others, leading to continuous improvements in nutritional outcomes.

#### 1.4. **San Julián**

San Julián shows **stable but low malnutrition rates** throughout the years, with only a slight decrease in 2015. The rates are among the lowest in the dataset, indicating that this community may have consistently effective nutrition and health interventions in place.

#### 1.5. **Cluster Morazán**

Cluster Morazán demonstrates **gradual improvement** in malnutrition, with the most noticeable decline occurring in 2017. This suggests a slow but steady progression toward reducing malnutrition, possibly due to ongoing intervention programs that have had a cumulative effect over time.

### Patterns Summary

-   **High malnutrition** and fluctuating rates in **Guaymango** and **Chiltiupan** indicate challenges with sustaining improvements.
-   **Apaneca, Ataco, and San Julián** show positive or stable trends, suggesting effective interventions.
-   **Cluster Morazán** is steadily improving, likely benefiting from consistent efforts to address malnutrition.

## 2. Unexpected Findings

A few unexpected patterns emerged from the data:

### 2.1. **Sharp Decline and Rebound in Guaymango**

Guaymango’s malnutrition rate experienced a **sharp decline** in 2015, falling from above 40% to around 14%. This was followed by a **gradual rebound** in the following years. This raises questions about what caused such a dramatic drop and why it was not sustained. Understanding the specific factors that led to the temporary success in 2015 could help shape future interventions.

### 2.2. **Fluctuations in Chiltiupan**

Chiltiupan shows a **rise and fall pattern**, with a decline in malnutrition in 2015, followed by a rise again in subsequent years. This suggests that while some short-term success was achieved, the interventions were not able to maintain their effectiveness long-term.

## 3. Questions for FUSAL Staff

To further interpret these patterns and identify the factors influencing malnutrition rates, the following questions could be posed to the FUSAL staff:

### 3.1. **Guaymango**

-   What specific **interventions or programs** were implemented in 2015 that caused such a dramatic drop in malnutrition?
-   Were there any external factors, such as **economic conditions or food availability**, that contributed to the rise in malnutrition after 2015?
-   What were the key **challenges** in sustaining the success seen in 2015?

### 3.2. **Chiltiupan**

-   What led to the **sharp decline** in malnutrition in 2015, and why was this trend not sustained?
-   Were there any changes in **funding, community engagement, or policies** that could explain the rise in malnutrition after 2015?

### 3.3. **Cluster Morazán**

-   What specific **strategies or interventions** were employed in 2017 that led to the noticeable decline in malnutrition?
-   Could these strategies be **replicated** in other communities to achieve similar results?

## 4. Conclusions Based on the Data

### 4.1. **Guaymango**

The consistently high malnutrition rates in Guaymango suggest persistent challenges, even though 2015 saw a temporary improvement. There are likely deeper **structural issues** at play, such as food security, economic instability, or insufficient long-term support. A more detailed investigation into what worked in 2015 and why it failed afterward could help develop more sustainable interventions.

### 4.2. **Chiltiupan**

Chiltiupan’s malnutrition rates demonstrate the importance of **sustaining interventions** over time. Short-term successes must be followed by ongoing support and adaptability to changing circumstances, which may have been lacking in this community.

### 4.3. **Apaneca and Ataco**

The steady decline in malnutrition in Apaneca and Ataco indicates that these communities are **benefiting from effective interventions**. These programs should be further supported and could serve as models for replication in other areas.

### 4.4. **San Julián**

San Julián’s stable malnutrition rates indicate that **effective systems** are in place for maintaining community health. Monitoring and reinforcing these strategies will ensure that the community continues to maintain low malnutrition levels.

### 4.5. **Cluster Morazán**

The gradual improvement in Cluster Morazán highlights the **long-term benefits** of sustained interventions. Focusing on refining and scaling successful programs could accelerate the decline in malnutrition rates.

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1. **Short-Term Recommendations**

-   **Investigate Guaymango’s 2015 success**: A focused investigation into the interventions and external factors that contributed to the sharp decline in malnutrition in 2015 could provide insights for future strategies.
-   **Reassess interventions in Chiltiupan**: Conduct a review of interventions and their long-term sustainability in Chiltiupan to address the fluctuations in malnutrition rates.
-   **Leverage success stories from Apaneca and Ataco**: Study the interventions in Apaneca and Ataco and identify key components that can be replicated in communities facing higher malnutrition rates.

### 5.2. **Long-Term Recommendations**

-   **Sustain and scale effective interventions**: For communities showing positive trends, such as Apaneca, Ataco, and Cluster Morazán, continued support and scaling of successful interventions should be prioritized.
-   **Strengthen community engagement and adaptability**: Ensure that interventions are adaptable to changing community needs and that community members are actively involved in the planning and execution of programs to promote sustainability.
-   **Develop targeted strategies for high-risk communities**: For communities like Guaymango, develop long-term, multi-faceted approaches that address structural barriers to reducing malnutrition.

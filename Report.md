# FUSAL Malnutrition Case Study: Data Analysis Report

### Overview

This report is an analysis of malnutrition data for various communities in El Salvador from 2014 to 2017, conducted as part of the **Social Innovation diploma** at **UPEACE**, for the course **Monitoring & Evaluation Fundamentals: Measuring Outcomes & Impact**. The goal of this analysis is to detect malnutrition patterns, evaluate the effectiveness of interventions, and provide actionable recommendations for improving community health outcomes.

### Key Communities Analyzed

-   **Guaymango**
-   **Chiltiupan**
-   **Apaneca**
-   **Ataco**
-   **San Julián**
-   **Cluster Morazán**

## Patterns Observed in the Data

#### **Guaymango**

Guaymango shows consistently **higher levels of chronic malnutrition** across all years, with a significant spike in 2014, where the rate surpassed 40%. After a sharp decline in 2015 to about 14%, malnutrition rates began to rise again, suggesting that while interventions in 2015 were initially effective, they were not sustainable over time.

#### **Chiltiupan**

Chiltiupan exhibits a fluctuating pattern. Malnutrition rates dropped significantly in **2015**, indicating effective interventions or positive external factors during that year. However, this was followed by a rise in malnutrition in **2016** and **2017**, showing that the gains were short-lived, and the situation worsened again over time.

#### **Apaneca and Ataco**

Both Apaneca and Ataco present a **positive trend** of declining malnutrition rates, especially after 2015. This suggests that the interventions in these communities have been more effective and sustained compared to others, leading to continuous improvements in nutritional outcomes.

#### **San Julián**

San Julián shows **stable but low malnutrition rates** throughout the years, with only a slight decrease in 2015. The rates are among the lowest in the dataset, indicating that this community may have consistently effective nutrition and health interventions in place.

#### 1.5. **Cluster Morazán**

Cluster Morazán demonstrates **gradual improvement** in malnutrition, with the most noticeable decline occurring in 2017. This suggests a slow but steady progression toward reducing malnutrition, possibly due to ongoing intervention programs that have had a cumulative effect over time.

### Patterns Summary

![Heat map showing malnutrition data](https://github.com/ib-frida/FUSAL-Case-Study-Analysis/blob/ec495bfbe0e354977c79d66385772319c1af3ef8/heatmap.png)

-   **High malnutrition** and fluctuating rates in **Guaymango** and **Chiltiupan** indicate challenges with sustaining improvements.
-   **Apaneca, Ataco, and San Julián** show positive or stable trends, suggesting effective interventions.
-   **Cluster Morazán** is steadily improving, likely benefiting from consistent efforts to address malnutrition.

## Unexpected Findings

A few unexpected patterns emerged from the data:

### **Sharp Decline and Rebound in Guaymango**

Guaymango’s malnutrition rate experienced a **sharp decline** in 2015, falling from above 40% to around 14%. This was followed by a **gradual rebound** in the following years. This raises questions about what caused such a dramatic drop and why it was not sustained. Understanding the specific factors that led to the temporary success in 2015 could help shape future interventions.

### **Fluctuations in Chiltiupan**

Chiltiupan shows a **rise and fall pattern**, with a decline in malnutrition in 2015, followed by a rise again in subsequent years. This suggests that while some short-term success was achieved, the interventions were not able to maintain their effectiveness long-term.

## Conclusions Based on the Data

### **Guaymango**

The consistently high malnutrition rates in Guaymango suggest persistent challenges, even though 2015 saw a temporary improvement. There are likely deeper **structural issues** at play, such as food security, economic instability, or insufficient long-term support. A more detailed investigation into what worked in 2015 and why it failed afterward could help develop more sustainable interventions.

### **Chiltiupan**

Chiltiupan’s malnutrition rates demonstrate the importance of **sustaining interventions** over time. Short-term successes must be followed by ongoing support and adaptability to changing circumstances, which may have been lacking in this community.

### **Apaneca and Ataco**

The steady decline in malnutrition in Apaneca and Ataco indicates that these communities are **benefiting from effective interventions**. These programs should be further supported and could serve as models for replication in other areas.

### **San Julián**

San Julián’s stable malnutrition rates indicate that **effective systems** are in place for maintaining community health. Monitoring and reinforcing these strategies will ensure that the community continues to maintain low malnutrition levels.

### **Cluster Morazán**

The gradual improvement in Cluster Morazán highlights the **long-term benefits** of sustained interventions. Focusing on refining and scaling successful programs could accelerate the decline in malnutrition rates.
